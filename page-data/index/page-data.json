She had everything she needed, but she was missing a mirror. She asked Lord Shiva for a mirror. Lord Shiva dug the earth with his Trishool and formed a pond. The pond (kund) had such clear water that it reflected just like a mirror. Devi Parvathi could see her beauty (roop) in that pond (kund). Hence, the name Roopkund. Roopkund is a small lake above the snowline of the Greater Himalayas. It is a very small swallow lake, maximum 2 meters in depth and generally remain under the snow for 8 months in a year. At the first glance, nothing special is here. I mean, a 2 meter deep lake, that too without water, is not worth visiting after 24 hours of road journey from Delhi and then a 3-days trek in the middle of a dense forest of Burans, a widespread meadow, some steep climbs on the hills, where you spend your night in a small tent.
