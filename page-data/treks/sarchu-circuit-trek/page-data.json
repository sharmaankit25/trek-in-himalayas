Very few people cross this trail each year. One has to be self-sufficient on this trek. For 2 days in the trek you would go through Zanskar villages and can get an idea of the Zanskari culture.One can see the magnificient Phugtal Gompa.You would be greeted by ?Jhulley? all along the way.  As I was having lunch and resting at Bharatpur I was thinking over the next part of my journey.  Surely, I won?t get lucky again and find another group trekking over Phitse-la into Zanskar. Since it is not a frequented route would there be any trail.
