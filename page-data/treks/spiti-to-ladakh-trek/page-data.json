The old trade route to Ladakh and Tibet may have been tarmacked, but most of this remote and spectacular region is still only accessible on foot. Its trails, though well frequented in high season, are long, hard and high, punctuated by few settlements, so be ready for this unending exploration journey!  This is one of the most remote and challenging treks, crossing passes as high as 18,300 ft. We follow ancient trade routes still used by the nomadic herdsmen of Changtang.
