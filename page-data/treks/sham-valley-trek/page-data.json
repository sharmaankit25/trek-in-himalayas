There is no way one could be left untouched by the dream land that was transformed thanks to the stream that is watering the lands and bringing prosperity and wild natural beauty.  The main Ladakhi monasteries are lying in the remains of the ancient Kingdom of Sham, while there are many astonishing sites around to visit, like alchi, Lamayuru, Phyang, Spituk, Hemis, Thikse and Shey, which are all reachable via the road. Finally, Likir, Ridzong and Temisgang follow you when trekking through the beautiful Ladakh trek route.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/136.jpg","max_altitude":"13058","near_airport":"Leh","nearest_motorable_location":"Likir","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"398","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Meptak La","temp_range":"Min: -5 Max: 20","time_duration":"8 Days 7 Nights","trek_id":"136"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/sham-valley-trek","slug":"sham-valley-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
