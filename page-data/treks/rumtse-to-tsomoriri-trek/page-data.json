Best time to undertake it is between June and September. The highest point of this trek is Shibuk La which is at 5016 m. There are monasteries, wildlife, lakes to see and encounter with the nomads makes this an unforgettable experience.  We drive to rumtse and in between spend quite a bit of time exploring thikse as well as Hemis monasteries. From rumtse we go to Kyamar on foot. We trail along abandoned army huts, reach a river, cross that and keep trekking along it. From here we go to Tisaling via Kyumur La and Mandalchan La. We come across several wild flowers, do some real exhausting climb and let the trail divide into two one leading to Tso Kar lake and other into a Mandalchan La.  From Tisaling we cross Shibuk La and cross the beautiful sight of Tsokar lake. From pangunagu we walk across to Nuruchan. En route we come across agricultural fields and arrive at the camp. After trekking for an hour and half we travel north east to Rachungkaru. From here we move to Kyamayur La that takes 2 hours crossing a small pass Gyama La.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/143.jpg","max_altitude":"16457","near_airport":"Leh","nearest_motorable_location":"Rumtse","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"511","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Shibuk La","temp_range":"Min: -10 Max: 8","time_duration":"9 Days 8 Nights","trek_id":"143"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/rumtse-to-tsomoriri-trek","slug":"rumtse-to-tsomoriri-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
