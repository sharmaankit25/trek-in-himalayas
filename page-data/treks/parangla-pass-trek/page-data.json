The complete trek ends at the Tso Moriri lake famous for the rare bird species that are found here. The journey begins at Kibber which till recently was the highest permanent settlement connected by a motorable road. The trek is down the Kibber Gorge and uphill again to Dumla which is the last human settlement until Karzog. The camp can be set up at Thaltak meadow just below the Thaltak pass. This pass is crossed with a descent again down the Rongchu nalla and back to climbing. The next campsite is at Bongrochen which means ?Donkeys corpse?. The actual trek to Parang la pass begins here and the high altitude starts to take its toll on the body. The crossover at Parang la brings us to the snow laden and green valley on the Ladakh side, from the rock laden and barren regions of the Spiti valley. The descent begins by crossing the Pare Chu river at the mouth of the glacier.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/98.jpg","max_altitude":"18307","near_airport":"Bhuntar (Kullu)","nearest_motorable_location":"Kaza","nearest_railway":"Jogindernagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"345","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Parang La","temp_range":"Min: -7 Max: 8","time_duration":"16 Days 15 Nights","trek_id":"98"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/parangla-pass-trek","slug":"parangla-pass-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
