Located at a distance of nearly 8 km from Osla, the lake is close to Har-Ki-Doon Valley and Swargarohini Mountain. The main snow clad peaks visible from here are Swarga-Rohini, Bandarpunch and Kala Nag.  Har ? Ki Dun is around 12 km away from Osla. Initially, the trekking trail leads you through fields of beans and rice and some secluded villages. Steadily the trail ascends to the side of the ridge across the river. Then the trail takes a detour to the left to the Har Ki Dun valley.  Ruinsiara Tal is at an altitude of 3500 m and is ensconced between a small ridge and the left wall of the valley. The trek route passes through Debsu Bughyal, and trail is dotted with terraced mountain fields, patches of verdant grassy lands and punctuated with coniferous forests.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/23.jpg","max_altitude":"11482","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Sankri","nearest_railway":"Dehradun","railway_code":"DDN","railway_distance":"218","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Ruinsara Tal, Debsu Bughyal","temp_range":"Min: 2 Max: 15","time_duration":"8 Days 7 Nights","trek_id":"23"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/har-ki-doon-ruinsara-tal-trek","slug":"har-ki-doon-ruinsara-tal-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
