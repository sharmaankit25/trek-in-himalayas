Sandwiched between the Indus Valley and the main crest of the Indian Himalayas, this remote and inaccessible setting, well guarded by snowy mountain passes, has kept alive an archaic form of Tibetan Buddhism which flourishes in chains of far-flung monasteries, most of which occupy spectacular fortified locations, high on rocky ridges in isolated valleys.  Lovely high meadow camp sites and dry desert lands, high passes and snow-capped peaks, stunning scenery, Buddhist monasteries and picturesque villages with their irrigated fields of barley and potatoes, and fascinating encounters with the Zanskari people turn a trek in this area into an unforgettable experience. The 14 days trip promises this and much more. Come see the heaven on earth.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/146.jpg","max_altitude":"16404","near_airport":"Leh","nearest_motorable_location":"Padum","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"454","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Singe La","temp_range":"Min: 4 Max: 30","time_duration":"14 Days 13 Nights","trek_id":"146"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/padum-to-lamayuru-trek","slug":"padum-to-lamayuru-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
