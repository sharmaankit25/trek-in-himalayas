Located at a distance of 26 KMs north of Sangla and situated at height of 3450 feet, this place is like a pre-Raphaelite painting. The frosty Himalayan River Baspa flows through it having meandered through mysterious pine forests. It overlooks the snow-capped Nee-La range. It?s the Nee-la wherefrom Baspa originates. The village abounds in typical Himachali architectural cottages of slate or wooden roofs. The Kagyupa temple has special significance because it houses a rare image of Shakyamuni Buddha with four directional kinds placed on every side. They say that the presiding deity of the village, Mathi is very alive and must be paid homage to. It falls directly on the Kinner Kailash parikrama route.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/68.jpg","max_altitude":"11320","near_airport":"Shimla","nearest_motorable_location":"Tapri","nearest_railway":"Shimla","railway_code":"SML","railway_distance":"192","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Chitkul","temp_range":"Min: -1 Max: 20","time_duration":"7 Days 6 Nights","trek_id":"68"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/tapri-to-chitkul-trek","slug":"tapri-to-chitkul-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
