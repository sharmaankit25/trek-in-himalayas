Located at an altitude of 4300 m, Chandra Tal Lake is just 6 kms away from the Kunzum Pass in Spiti and Lahaul district of Himachal Pradesh state of India.Walking on Chandra Tal trek will offer an ultimate experience similar to the experience of going to the moon. You will pass through two high mountain ranges named Moulkila and Chandrabhaga, which are quite challenging for mountaineers. Further, you will see the beautiful snow-covered mountain peaks and slopes. There is a legendary story associated with this lake. It is believed that this lake is located at a place from where the chariot of the god Indra picked up Yudhishthira, the eldest of the Pandava brothers. As a result, Chandra Tal is counted among sacred lakes of India and grabs the attention of lots of Hindu devotees.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/122.jpg","max_altitude":"14107","near_airport":"Bhuntar (Kullu)","nearest_motorable_location":"Manali","nearest_railway":"Jogindernagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"143","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Chandra Tal","temp_range":"Min: 0 Max: 20","time_duration":"5 Days 4 Nights","trek_id":"122"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/chandertal-lake-trek","slug":"chandertal-lake-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
