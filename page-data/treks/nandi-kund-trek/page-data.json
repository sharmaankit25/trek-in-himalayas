Kalpeshwar trail. The trail commands a beautiful view of lush green meadows and the snow covered Chaukhamba group of peaks of and Mandani Parbat. It is a lake spread over an area of 1.5 km. This high altitude trek takes you over the high ranges without involving the glaciers or even snow if attempted in autumn. However, during spring and early summer, you may find plenty of snow. The Trail covers Madhyamaheshwar, Kachani Dhar, Pandavsera, Nandikund, Ghiya Vinayak Pass, Bansinarayan and Kalpeshwar. The Pandavsera valley is 3-4 km. wide and local people believe that the Pandavas stayed here for a long time, dug a canal and transformed it into cultivable land. Ghiya Vinayak pass is really a challenging task for trekkers as the route to the pass is very tricky and it is advisable to take an experienced guide along. Since some part of the trail falls under Kedarnath wildlife sanctuary there is a good chance of encountering wildlife like Brown Bear, Leopard, Marten, Weasels, Pika etc.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/40.jpg","max_altitude":"15748","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Uniyana","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"199","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Nandi Kund","temp_range":"Min: 5 Max: 30","time_duration":"8 Days 7 Nights","trek_id":"39"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/nandi-kund-trek","slug":"nandi-kund-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
