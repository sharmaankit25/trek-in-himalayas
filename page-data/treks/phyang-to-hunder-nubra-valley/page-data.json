This valley features open plains and camels that can be found roaming around the Shayok River. The politic allocation of the valley enabled its opening to foreign visitors not until the later half of the 1990s. Compared to Leh, Nubra is around 400 meters lower in height and has a variety in terms of climate. This has enabled the locals to engage in extensive cultivation compared to those living in the Indus Valley.    The Phyang to Hunder Nubra Valley journey is almost untouched and the amazing splendor of the landscape offers breathtaking views of the vast Karakoram mountain range. As you move towards the last day of the journey, it would appear that the beauty of the surroundings keep increasing. Part of the journey is the drive over the worlds highest motor-able road at over 5,600 meters.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/148.jpg","max_altitude":"16896","near_airport":"Leh","nearest_motorable_location":"Phyang","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"431","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"La Sermo","temp_range":"Min: 4 Max: 30","time_duration":"7 Days 6 Nights","trek_id":"148"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/phyang-to-hunder-nubra-valley","slug":"phyang-to-hunder-nubra-valley"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
