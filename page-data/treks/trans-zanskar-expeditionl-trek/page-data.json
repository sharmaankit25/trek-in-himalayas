A tour of few days shorter in a month, Trans Zanskar Expedition takes off from the Darcha Village on the Manali Leh road, and thus begins the adventure trekking holidays on the rugged terrain to Ladakh.   The distance covered while trekking would vary each day depending upon the planned schedule and the amount of discipline with which it followed on a regular basis. Trekking on initial few days is for lesser time in comparison to the days that follow, and then the trekking time is continuously changes so that bodies adapt to the altitude they are reaching to. Some lesser known rivers will be encountered on the way in addition to the River Zanskar. The valley by the same name keeps a constant company onwards from Raru Village which is reached on Day 12 of the expedition.   The monasteries that the trekking will visit during the trip is something to savor because this kind of tasteful concoction of faith, religion and simplicity can never be a part of cities to which tourists and adventurers generally belong. The elements of Nature always remain in backdrop for the sake of being there and constantly accompany the trekking enthusiasts in their zeal to win over the challenges, until the trip culminates at Leh.   If this could not stir the trekker in you, nothing else can. The itinerary of the trip is waiting for your consideration.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/163.jpg","max_altitude":"16700","near_airport":"Bhuntar","nearest_motorable_location":"Palemo","nearest_railway":"Joginder nagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"374","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Shingo la","temp_range":"Min: -3 Max: 20","time_duration":"27 Days 26 Nights","trek_id":"163"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/trans-zanskar-expeditionl-trek","slug":"trans-zanskar-expeditionl-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
