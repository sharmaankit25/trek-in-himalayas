The Bhilangna Valley is a delight not only for the nature lover and the trekker but also the photographer, and replete with stunning views of snow capped peaks and hanging glaciers. The Khatling glacier is ringed  by snow peaks of the Jogin group (6466 m), Sphetic Pristwar (6905 m), Barte Kauter (6579 m), Kirti Stambh (6902 m) and Meru. The trek covers thick forests and beautiful lush green grassy meadows in the beginning and then goes over moraines on the side of the glaciers and later over a very treacherous surface consisting of scree and loose moraine! All in all this trek provides one with a sense of achievement. The trek has the option to be modified to cover the picturesque Panwali Kantha high altitude grassland, on the return trip, to finally emerge at the Trijuginarayan temple (the sacred spot where Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati tied the knot!","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/8.jpg","max_altitude":"12795","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Ghuttu","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"184","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Panwali Kantha Grasslands","temp_range":"Min: -3 Max 20","time_duration":"18 Days 17 Nights","trek_id":"8"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/khatling-trek","slug":"khatling-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
