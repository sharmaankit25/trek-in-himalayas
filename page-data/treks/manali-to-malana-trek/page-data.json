Malana in Himachal Pradesh is a tribal village, which is considered as the oldest democracy in the world. The trek ends at the Baralacha Pass on the Manali-Leh road.  Malana trek lies a little ahead of the beautiful Chandra Khanni Pass in the tiny village of Malana, an isolated community that has its own language, customs and laws, governed by a parliament of village elders called Koram.  There is the snowy range of the area lying between the Pir Panjal and Dhauladhar ranges in the Bara Banghal area of the Central Himachal Pradesh. After then we will visit the Parbati valley, hemmed in by giant pinnacled mountain peaks. It twists west from the glaciers and snowfields.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/121.jpg","max_altitude":"12007","near_airport":"Bhuntar (Kullu)","nearest_motorable_location":"Rumsu","nearest_railway":"Jogindernagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"130","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Malana","temp_range":"Min: 0 Max: 20","time_duration":"7 Days 6 Nights","trek_id":"121"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/manali-to-malana-trek","slug":"manali-to-malana-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
