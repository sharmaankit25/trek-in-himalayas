Up in the paradise, where nature itself beholds the extraterrestrial environment, Ladakh draws the paths of the Ladakh Monastery Trek that passes through the marveling mountains and crystal blue lakes to emblazoned monasteries and Indo-Tibetan culture defining the confluence of nature and one of the varied colours of Indian religion.  Thiksey MonasteryLadakh, like of other regions in India, holds a vast history. From ancient trade routes between India and China (now Tibet) and the excavated rock carvings of the Neolithic times to the Kargil War of 1999, Ladakh is shrouded with many ancient civilizations and has been invaded by many dynasties. It is one of the celestial Buddhist Circuits in India that has risen by beautiful shrines, gumpas and ancient monasteries like Stok palace, Shep Palace, Thiksey, Hemis, Chimday, Takthok, Spituk, Likhir, Alchi and Lamayuru. Ladakh Monastery Trek is thus one of the spiritual treks in the Indian Himalayan region reflecting the lifestyle and festivals of the Indo Tibetans. The trek passes over days from Ladakh to Nubra and to Zanskar covering the snowbound remote villages perched atop the highland.  Lamayuru MonasteryThe Ladakh Monastery Trek will make you feel like you are in a dream. The heathen lifestyle of the Indo-Tibetans and the monasteries, the Zanskari culture and the festivals, avalanches, stupas, wildlife, unexplored canyons and crystal blue lakes and layers of magnificent ranges together make Ladakh a promising destination for adventurers, leisure tourists and pilgrims.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/161.jpg","max_altitude":"16240","near_airport":"Leh","nearest_motorable_location":"Lamayuru","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"331","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Kongskil La","temp_range":"Min: -3 Max: 20","time_duration":"12 Days 11 Nights","trek_id":"161"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/ladakh-monastery-trek","slug":"ladakh-monastery-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
