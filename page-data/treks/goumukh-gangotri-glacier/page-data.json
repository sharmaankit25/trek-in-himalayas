The trek takes you to Gomukh, the mythological source of the River Ganges, which is at the snout of the Gangotri glacier.  The shrine of Gangotri is situated at an elevation of 3200 m surrounded by deodars and pines. The original temple was constructed by the Gorkha General Amar Singh Thapa. Every year people from all around the world visit this shrine. A number of ashrams and dharamshalas are located on the other side of the river. It is believed that Raja Bhagirath used to worship Shiva on a slab of rock \"Bhagirath Shila\" situated near the temple.
