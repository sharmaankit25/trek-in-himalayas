The trek is flagged off from the capital city Srinagar and cutting and crossing Sonmarg, Nichinai, Krishansar and Dubta Pani, one finally reaches the pristine Gangabal Lake. Needless to mention that Gangabal Lake is amongst the most beautiful places in Kashmir; also it is a less explored destination. The trekking route of Gangabal passes through many picturesque places, and one would be particularly stupefied by the sight of Himalayan wildlife and striking flora. The trek introduces many challenging situations for a trekker, and great skills are needed to overcome them. Giving the weary trekker a breather are the flower-strewn meadows, alpine lakes like Kishansar and Vishansar, and the lofty Mt. Haramukh (5,380 m). The nomadic tribes of Gujars and Bakarwals add an extra dimension to the trekking trail of Gangabal.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/133.jpg","max_altitude":"14764","near_airport":"Srinagar","nearest_motorable_location":"Sonamarg","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"103","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Zagibal peak","temp_range":"Min: -15 Max: 10","time_duration":"9 Days 8 Nights","trek_id":"133"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/gangabal-lake-trek","slug":"gangabal-lake-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
