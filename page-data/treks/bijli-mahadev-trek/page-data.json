It is believed that the priest of the temple has to restore the Shiva linga placed inside the temple using butter and sattoo after every lightning episode, as it shatters to pieces each time. In that sense, the temple is said to be a defender of the valley, as it bears the brunt of every thunderstorm.The temple is indigenously built of wood and stone, a form of typical hill architecture with sloping roofs made of wooden planks. Inside the sanctum is a 1.5-feet tall Shiva Linga. Outside the temple are two imposing stone statues of Nandi. It is believed the temple was established by Shankaracharya to revive Hinduism.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/75.jpg","max_altitude":"7677","near_airport":"Bhuntar (Kullu)","nearest_motorable_location":"Chansari","nearest_railway":"Jogindernagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"127","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Matikochar","temp_range":"Min: 5 Max: 30","time_duration":"4 Days 3 Nights","trek_id":"75"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/bijli-mahadev-trek","slug":"bijli-mahadev-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
