It marks the place where Guru Govind Singh, the tenth and last Guru, unified with God after prolonged meditation in his previous birth. The guru's autobiography which contains a description of the place helped two devout Sikhs, Sant Sohan Singh and Havldar Mohan singh to rediscover it. According to Hindu mythology, Hemkund or Lokpal as it is also known, is where Lakshman had done his enance.   Hemkund is a 15km trek from Govindghat, which is the gateway to the Bhyundar or Lakshman Ganga valley. Govindghat is one of the bus route to Badrinath. The trek from here to Hemkund takes one through forests of pine and rhododendron where wild roses, ferns and alpine flowers bloom. The surging waters of the Lakshman Ganga are also visible. The last 5km of the trek entails a steep climb from Ghangharia, which is a base for visiting Hemkund.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/33.jpg","max_altitude":"14202","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Govindghat","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"269","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Hemkunt Sahib","temp_range":"Min: 6 Max: 23","time_duration":"6 Days 5 Nights","trek_id":"36"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/hemkund-sahib-trek","slug":"hemkund-sahib-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
