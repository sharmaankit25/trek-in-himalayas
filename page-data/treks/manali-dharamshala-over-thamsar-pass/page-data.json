The people of Bara Bhanghal prefer to cross the high Thamsar Pass and go Baijnath for their daily needs rather than go towards Holi and Chamba. Though a part of Chamba Valley, Bara Bhanghal is administratively linked with Kangra district. Many streams rising on slopes of the Bara Bhanghal Range unite here to form the Ravi River. This trail provides an insight into the life of Gaddi People living in the valley.From Thamsar pass to Bara Bhanghal is one of the most pleasant and scenic treks in the Dhauladhar region, and because of the gradual, graded slopes on the northern side of the Dhauladhar no great exertion is needed. Rock shelters can also be found all along the way. Bara Bhanghal lies in a bowl at the base of three high ranges, and many glacier torrents join near the village to form the Ravi River.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/78.jpg","max_altitude":"15502","near_airport":"Bhuntar (Kullu)","nearest_motorable_location":"Manali","nearest_railway":"Jogindernagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"143","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Thamsar Pass","temp_range":"Min: -2 Max: 20","time_duration":"12 Days 11 Nights","trek_id":"78"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/manali-dharamshala-over-thamsar-pass","slug":"manali-dharamshala-over-thamsar-pass"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
