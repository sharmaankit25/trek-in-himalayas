It is also a world where the only way to travel is on foot or by pony. This trek takes us from the Lahaul valley of Himachal Pradesh into the ancient kingdom of Zanskar, where we visit the remarkable cave gompa of Phugtal. The people, the scenery and the challenge make this a truly unique adventure.  Most of the visitors travel to the remote parts of Zanskar region for trekking. Numerous trails wind their way north from Padum to Central Ladakh, west of Kishtwar and south to Neighbouring Lahaul - all along hard hikes that involve strenuous ups and downs. The two main routes leading in to Zanskar, despite the region's isolation are those from Kargil and from Manali to Padum.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/164.jpg","max_altitude":"18130","near_airport":"Bhuntar","nearest_motorable_location":"Rarig","nearest_railway":"Joginder nagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"295","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Phitse la","temp_range":"Min: -7 Max: 20","time_duration":"19 Days 18 Nights","trek_id":"164"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/southern-zanskar-trek","slug":"southern-zanskar-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
