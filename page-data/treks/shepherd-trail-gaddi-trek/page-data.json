The journey stretches from an elevation of about 2,050 meters to 4,800 meters. The highest point on this trail is the Kalihani pass at an elevation of 4,800 meters. The journey traverses through several other high altitude mountain passes, namely the Khanpari pass at 3,600 meters and Thamsar Pass at 3,500 meters. The Gaddi Trek, which is one of the alpine treks in Himachal Pradesh, passes through numerous shepherd villages and grazing cattle farms tucked high in the mountains. The trail is enriched by several alpine woodlands and meadows, wild animals and colourful orchards and gushing streams. Filled with adventure and cultural grandeur the journey becomes more strenuous when coming in contact with the tricky and slippery glaciated tracks.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/73.jpg","max_altitude":"15744","near_airport":"Bhuntar (Kullu)","nearest_motorable_location":"Manali","nearest_railway":"Jogindernagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"143","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Kalihali pass","temp_range":"Min: -1 Max: 20","time_duration":"18 Days 17 Nights","trek_id":"73"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/shepherd-trail-gaddi-trek","slug":"shepherd-trail-gaddi-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
