With the melting snow of the Dhauladhar Range as the source of water, this quaint lake and the terrains that leads to it, entices trekkers from different corners of the world.  While the Dhauladhar Range adds to the mesmeric appeal of this lake, the fact that it remains frozen during early December to March/April, serves as the main attraction of this trek. The Kareri Lake trekking originates from the Kangra District of Himachal Pradesh and takes the participants through lush forests, narrow terrains, whirly passes, scenic meadows and much more. Adding more, while on this trek, the trekkers can also participate in local tours and adventure activities like Tyrolean Traversing.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/53.jpg","max_altitude":"10827","near_airport":"Gaggal","nearest_motorable_location":"Salli village","nearest_railway":"Kangra","railway_code":"KGRA","railway_distance":"47","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Kareri Lake","temp_range":"Min: 0 Max: 20","time_duration":"8 Days 7 Nights","trek_id":"53"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/kareri-lake-trek","slug":"kareri-lake-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
