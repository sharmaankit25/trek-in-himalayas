Further enhancing the splendour of the lake are the surrounding peaks of ? Thalaisagar, Meru, Bhrigupanth and Jogin whose melting snow sustains it. On a clear day the ?tal? mirrors a breathtaking reflection of the Thalaisagar peak.  Though the terrain is simple this trek is strenuous and requires previous mountain trekking experience . The steepness of the trail as well as the large altitude gain makes it important to distribute the ascent over 3 days to acclimatize to the high altitude and climate. The autumn flora and fauna along the way make it worth the struggle.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/24.jpg","max_altitude":"15567","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Gangotri","nearest_railway":"Dehradun","railway_code":"DDN","railway_distance":"242","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Kedartal","temp_range":"Min -4 Max 22","time_duration":"6 Days 5 Nights","trek_id":"24"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/kedartal-trek","slug":"kedartal-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
