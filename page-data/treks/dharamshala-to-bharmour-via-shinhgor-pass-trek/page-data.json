Thousands flock this city for spiritual healing, for a relook at philosophy, for getting up close and personal with nature at its pristine best, for culinary adventures that are a perfect solace to a food connoisseur and much more. Dharamshala is a city nestled in the Kangra valley within the lofty Dhauladhar ranges which protect it from three sides leaving the sprawling views of the unending valley on the fourth, with fields that have been articulately terraced and pretty ?pahari? girls rummaging through with daily chores moving in and out of those tiled roof topped homes. Dharamshala was called ?Bhagsu? in its days of yore.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/92.jpg","max_altitude":"14157","near_airport":"Gaggal","nearest_motorable_location":"Bandla","nearest_railway":"Kangra","railway_code":"KGRA","railway_distance":"142","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Shinghor Pass","temp_range":"Min: -2 Max: 20","time_duration":"8 Days 7 Nights","trek_id":"92"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/dharamshala-to-bharmour-via-shinhgor-pass-trek","slug":"dharamshala-to-bharmour-via-shinhgor-pass-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
