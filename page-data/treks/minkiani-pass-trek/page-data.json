The access to Minkaini Pass is from   Kareri Lake which is located above the Kareri Village. In two days we will be   at Kareri Lake ( 3200m ). From Kareri Lake we will do a day trip to Minkiani   Pass. On top of the pass we will get views of the northern side. By late   afternoon we will return back to Kareri Lake. The next stage of the trek is to do    an interesting traverse of the Dhauladhar range by trekking towards the east.   On day six we will reach the beautiful camping ground of Triund which is the   initial camp for the Indrahar Pass. On the last day the tougher members of the   team can move to higher camps before returning back to Dharamsala and   completing this circular trek.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/79.jpg","max_altitude":"13944","near_airport":"Gaggal","nearest_motorable_location":"McLeod Ganj","nearest_railway":"Kangra","railway_code":"KGRA","railway_distance":"27","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Minkiani Pass","temp_range":"Min: 0 Max: 20","time_duration":"9 Days 8 Nights","trek_id":"79"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/minkiani-pass-trek","slug":"minkiani-pass-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
