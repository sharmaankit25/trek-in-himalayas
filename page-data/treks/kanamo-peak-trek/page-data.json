Short in nature, it is one of the ideal ways to enjoy a 6,000m experience of trekking in India. The Kanamo Peak trek trail opens up many splendours of the mighty Himalayas. Adding to the entire experience is the trekking experience to mesmeric Chandratal and camping by the water body. You will be making your way through Spiti Valley, passing by old world charmed monasteries and ambling through high hamlets. Those who are interested can engage in rafting in Spiti River.  Initially, during the trekking activity, you will be driven from Manali through Rohtang Pass and Lahaul Valley before arriving at Batal. Then, you enjoy the trek to Chandratal, a high altitude glacial lake that is perched at 4300m. It is named so because of the half-moon shape and is ringed with mountains and many shepherd camps making for a divine sight.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/54.jpg","max_altitude":"19685","near_airport":"Bhuntar (Kullu)","nearest_motorable_location":"Batal","nearest_railway":"Jogindernagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"257","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Kanamo Peak","temp_range":"Min: -7 Max: 9","time_duration":"7 Days 6 Nights","trek_id":"54"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/kanamo-peak-trek","slug":"kanamo-peak-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
