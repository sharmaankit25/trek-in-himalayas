It forms part of the boundary of Nako village and seems that the village is half buried in the lake border. It is about 3,662 metres (12014 ft) above sea level. The lake is surrounded by willow and poplar trees. Near the lake there are four Buddhist temples. Near this place there is a footlike impression ascribed to the saint Padmasambhava. Several miles away there is a village called Tashigang around which there are several caves where it is believed that Guru Padmasambhava meditated and gave discourse to followers. There is a waterfall nearby which has snow water falling like a river of milk. Legend says that it is a heavenly realm of fairies. In one of the caves you are still able to see the live footprints of these fairies or other demigods. It is a sacred place for the people of these valleys. Followers come from as far a place as Ladhak and spiti valley.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/72.jpg","max_altitude":"16000","near_airport":"Shimla","nearest_motorable_location":"Recong Peo","nearest_railway":"Shimla","railway_code":"SML","railway_distance":"223","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Temcho lake","temp_range":"Min: -6 Max: 13","time_duration":"7 Days 6 Nights","trek_id":"72"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/recong-peo-to-nako-trek","slug":"recong-peo-to-nako-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
