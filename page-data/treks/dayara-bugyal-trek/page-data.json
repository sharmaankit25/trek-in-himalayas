The trek brings us to a highland meadow  situated in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand which stands tall at an elevation of 10,000-12,500ft.  This lush green expanse of meadows serves as an excellent destination for skiing during winter and is spread over 28 sq km. This breathtaking location is nestled amidst towering snow-peaked mountains. While on this memorable Himalayan Dayara Bugyal trekking tour in India at Uttarkhand, catch sight of the lake of Barnala Tal strewn across the green alpine prairies? in whose reflection the peaks look even more beautiful.   The trek starts from the tiny hamlet of Barsu nestled on the Haridwar-Gangothri road which is 32 kms from Uttarkashi. One can settle in any one of the rest-houses or GMVN houses in Barsu that overlook the stunning valley on one side and the snowy mountains on the other.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/19.jpg","max_altitude":"12000","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Barsu","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"146","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Baksaria Top, Views of Barnala Tal","temp_range":"Min: -4 Max 25","time_duration":"7 Days 6 Nights","trek_id":"19"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/dayara-bugyal-trek","slug":"dayara-bugyal-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
