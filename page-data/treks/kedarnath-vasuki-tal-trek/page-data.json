The Kedarnath site, on the banks of River Mandakini, is the most remote of the four sites that is located close to the Chorabari Glacier and is flanked by breathtaking snow-capped peaks. It can be accessed after a trek of 21 kilometers from Sonprayag en route to Linchoni, Rambara and Garur Chatti, which is the nearest road head that connects Kedarnath to other parts of Garhwal Himalaya.  Well, beyond the pilgrimage site lies another serene and pristine beauty that is set in the midst of mountains layered with snow. The Vasuki Tal that offers a spiritual aura. It is approximately 5 kilometers up from Kedarnath and the thrilling trail allows you to get acquainted with the wildlife along with sprawling natural hues. Camping at the shore of this glacial lake is a unique part on your holy trip to Kedarnath.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/17.jpg","max_altitude":"11758","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Gaurikund","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"209","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Vasuki Tal","temp_range":"Min: 1 Max: 20","time_duration":"8 Days 7 Nights","trek_id":"17"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/kedarnath-vasuki-tal-trek","slug":"kedarnath-vasuki-tal-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
