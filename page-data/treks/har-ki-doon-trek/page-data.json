This moderate trek takes you to one of the least explored regions of Garhwal Himalayan region, where the passage of time has not affected the lifestyle of the simple hill folk inhabiting this Shangri La! As Har-Ki-Doon falls within the Govind Pashu Vihar wildlife santuary, chances of seeing wildlife are very bright indeed. The area, is known for its intricately carved houses, as the inhabitants here are an ingenuous lot, and the construction of the houses made with a combination of wooden beams and stones, not only looks aesthetic, but are also energy efficient as well as earth quake resistant. For those interested in religion or history, a visit to the beautifully carved temple dedicated to Duryodhana - the Kaurava Prince is a must visit!","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/2.jpg","max_altitude":"11675","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Sankri","nearest_railway":"Dehradun","railway_code":"DDN","railway_distance":"218","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Jaundhar Glacier","temp_range":"Min: 2 Max: 15","time_duration":"8 Days 7 Nights","trek_id":"2"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/har-ki-doon-trek","slug":"har-ki-doon-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
