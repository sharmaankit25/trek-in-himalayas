Nanda Devi. Nobody, save for a privileged few, is allowed to even set foot in her realm. A trek to Dharansi Pass is perhaps the only trek that allows one to venture close to the World Heritage Site of Nanda Devi Sanctuary. With a limited number of trekkers allowed to enter the park, one tends to feel fortunate to have even entered this real-life Shangri-la.  Added to that, the higher meadows of the Sanctuary are undiluted and pretty. The flowers are abundant and unspoiled. There is little or no human presence. To top it off, the views of the surrounding mountains of Garhwal are the best one can get. The Nanda Devi and Dunagiri, which are deliciously close, look larger than life while on this trek.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/25.jpg","max_altitude":"13800","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Joshimath","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"252","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Dharansi Pass","temp_range":"Min: -5 Max: 20","time_duration":"8 Days 7 Nights","trek_id":"25"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/nanda-devi-sanctuary-trek","slug":"nanda-devi-sanctuary-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
