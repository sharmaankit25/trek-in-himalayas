Traces of some ancient palaces, gompas and monasteries expose the diorama of the kingdom of Zanskar, which once dominated the region. Trekking in remote Zanskar requires sound mountaineering skills. Once you step into the isolated terrain, thereafter, at every turn you will come across surprises. The journey is filled with a good deal of adventure, passing through deep gorges formed by the River Zanskar, slithery and tricky moraines and narrow ridges. Further, the undulated topography with sparse and patches of vegetation along the river banks makes the journey contrasting and capturing as well. Nonetheless, the quaint and outback hamlets like Zangla, Sumdo, Tilat Sumdo, Nimaling simply displays the hard and hospitable lifestyle of the Ladakhis. The remote Zanskar trekking also presents the trekkers with the panorama of the magnificent twin peaks of Nun and Kun and far-fetched valleys and cascade of ranges seen from high altitude passes like Cha Cha la, Rubang La and Kongmaru La.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/162.jpg","max_altitude":"16895","near_airport":"Leh","nearest_motorable_location":"Padum","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"454","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Kongmaru La","temp_range":"Min: -3 Max: 20","time_duration":"18 Days 17 Nights","trek_id":"162"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/remote-zanskar-trek","slug":"remote-zanskar-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
