You have to go from Lahul valley (Mayar valley) to Zanskar valley by crossing the Great Himalayan Devider. Mayar is a tributary of Chenab river which is created from Mayar glacier. The 35 KM long glacier is situated below the Kang-La. Here you experience how a river is created, Glacier, Crevasses, Glacial Table as you have read in your geography book.Hanging glaciers, high pass, remote Buddhist villages, verdant and the stark, Kangla is one of the most demanding and wildly beautiful treks over the Himalaya. Starting in Miyar valley (Lahul-Himachal), the trek involves traversing over the 28 km long Miyar glacier and a crossing of the 5450 mt. high Kang la(pass) into Zanskar across the Great Himalaya range.The trek also captures the geographic contrast between the verdant Miyar and the stark Zanskar.
