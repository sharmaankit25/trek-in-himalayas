In this Ladakh trek we will cross from some of the high passes with excellent views of the Karakorams and the Zanskar mountains. The initial part of the trek ends at Chilling, a small village and the only one where Ladakhi metal work is carried out. From Chilling, one crosses the river by a cable pulley. A different set of ponies are on the other side of the river to carry our gear. We then continue on to Markha Valley - considered one of the most beautiful valleys in Ladakh.  Here, we pass through several Ladakhi settlements and observe their lifestyle. Several river crossings are involved, but these are not dangerous. Crossing several more passes, through gorges and wide open pastures, we end the trek at Matho village.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/155.jpg","max_altitude":"20997","near_airport":"Leh","nearest_motorable_location":"Lamayuru","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"331","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Kang Yatse","temp_range":"Min: -20 Max: 5","time_duration":"17 Days 16 Nights","trek_id":"155"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/lamayuru-to-rupsho-trek","slug":"lamayuru-to-rupsho-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
