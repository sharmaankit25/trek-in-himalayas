Along the way there are white Rhododendrons and expanse of green meadows.  There are different trails that access the Rupin Pass. One of them starts at the sleepy village of Gosangu which is the last road head of Himachal Pradesh. Generally, trekkers and adventurers travel to Gosangu by road from Shimla via Rohru. The alternate route to Rupin Pass starts from Naitwar, which is accessible from Dehradhun via Dhaula. From either of the two road heads, the first camp is Jhaka, the hanging village and the last stop for replenishing stocks and a look at the civilization. Traveling the Rupin Pass is a moderate - difficult level of climbing. The trails follow the Rupin river all the way to the top (Upper waterfall camp).","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/70.jpg","max_altitude":"14500","near_airport":"Shimla","nearest_motorable_location":"Recong Peo","nearest_railway":"Shimla","railway_code":"SML","railway_distance":"223","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Rupin Pass","temp_range":"Min: -5 Max: 14","time_duration":"8 Days 7 Nights","trek_id":"70"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/sangla-to-dodra-kwar-trek","slug":"sangla-to-dodra-kwar-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
