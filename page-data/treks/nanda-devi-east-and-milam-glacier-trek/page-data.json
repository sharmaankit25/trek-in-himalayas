It is not as easy as the nearby Pindari valley trek, but can be done without much preparation if you are   in good health. It is well away from the crowds on the traditional Uttaranchal pelgrim treks further west, so you will only see locals, porters on their way to the villages and army posts and a handful of trekkers. As in Pindari, there are villages and resthouses at good distances along the main path, so you can do this carrying just a light rucksack and a light sleeping bag - unless you want to go off into one of the side valleys or above the glacier, in which case you need all the usual gear. The highest point of the trek I describe \"the glacier\" is at about 3800m, so you won't have acclimatisation problems. But still there is a 2000m height difference along the path, with plenty of ups and downs.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/14.jpg","max_altitude":"13451","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Munsiyari","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"466","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Milam Glacier","temp_range":"Min: 0 Max: 20","time_duration":"15 Days 14 Nights","trek_id":"14"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/nanda-devi-east-and-milam-glacier-trek","slug":"nanda-devi-east-and-milam-glacier-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
