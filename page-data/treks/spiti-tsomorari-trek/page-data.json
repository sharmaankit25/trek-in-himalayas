After a night?s camping at the Tso Moriri lake, we walk across the plateau to the Chumik Sharte spring. The Parang la trek involves river crossings, crossing glaciers and crevasses and trekking to the top of the Parang la pass (5490m). The pass has prayer flags and the other side is dry and very steep descent. The climb to the Parang la pass is not without its challenges with the final four kilometres taking 2 hours. Parilungi is the last Ladakhi peak visible from Spiti and from there we descend to the source of the Pare Chu river. The scenery dramatically changes after crossing the Parang la, from steep gorges to broad plains. the last campsite is near a huge rock with a waterfall. But in end of September and October water dries up, therefore you have to carry water from the Parang La base.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/118.jpg","max_altitude":"18307","near_airport":"Bhuntar (Kullu)","nearest_motorable_location":"Kaza","nearest_railway":"Jogindernagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"345","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Parang La","temp_range":"Min: -7 Max: 8","time_duration":"9 Days 8 Nights","trek_id":"118"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/spiti-tsomorari-trek","slug":"spiti-tsomorari-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
