Considered as the holiest river in India, the holy Ganga is believed to have mystical powers and worshipped throughout the country.Originating from Gangotri, this awe-inspiring trek will take you through gradual and slow slopes, scenic terrains, picturesque passes and amazing views of the mountains and glaciers. At certain places, the terrains might get a bit difficult; however, overcoming them, you will be rewarded with bountiful views of the holy Ganges and some of the most desired peaks around Uttarakhand.  It?s not often that you come across a well-rounded trail that poses just the right amount of challenge for trekkers. As the trail to Pangarchulla Peak turns from green to a snowy pristine white, trekkers can treat their eyes to few of the highest peaks of the Garhwal region. Added to that, trekking during spring makes the lower trail a colourful one, with rhododendrons in full bloom!","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/22.jpg","max_altitude":"14642","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Gangotri","nearest_railway":"Dehradun","railway_code":"DDN","railway_distance":"242","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Tapovan","temp_range":"Min: -8 Max 12","time_duration":"11 Days 10 Nights","trek_id":"22"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/goumukh-tapovan-trek","slug":"goumukh-tapovan-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
