One of the more challenging routes, it takes one from the lush green Kullu valley to the stark landscapes of Bara Bhangal range. But for the trouble taken, it is a very fruitful trek for the people who are looking for isolated and in-tune-with-nature routes.  The eleven days Bara Bhangal Trek commences from Manali where we traverse through Indrasan and Bara Shigri glacier. We trek through Lama Dugh crossing Thanpri Tibba, glimpsing Manali on the run, just in time to reach our destination for the day-Riyali Thach.  You spend the rest of the day trekking through various routes, glimpsing various beautiful sceneries and on the 7th day reach our final destination.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/60.jpg","max_altitude":"15502","near_airport":"Bhuntar (Kullu)","nearest_motorable_location":"Manali","nearest_railway":"Jogindernagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"143","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Thamsar Pass","temp_range":"Min: -2 Max: 20","time_duration":"12 Days 11 Nights","trek_id":"60"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/bara-bhangal-trek","slug":"bara-bhangal-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
