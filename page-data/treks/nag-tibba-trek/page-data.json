Enjoy the magnificent views of Gujjar or shepherds dotting the envrons from the Nag Tibba Top.  Nag Tibba trek route is a circular trek where the finish point is different from the start point and at no time there is an overlap of trail. On your way down you will go through a completely contrasting landscape having a dense mixed forest of Oak, Rhododendron, Cider and Alpine. Adding to the beauty of the trek is the opportunity to visit a couple of quaint villages which are extremely scenically situated amidst thick Deodar forests. Icing on the top would surely be the opportunity to dunk one's feet into a cold and inviting stream at the end of the trek.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/26.jpg","max_altitude":"10006","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Pantwari","nearest_railway":"Dehradun","railway_code":"DDN","railway_distance":"90","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Nag Tibba Top","temp_range":"Min: 6 Max 25","time_duration":"3 Days 2 Nights","trek_id":"26"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/nag-tibba-trek","slug":"nag-tibba-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
