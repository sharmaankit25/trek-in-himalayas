The trek starts from Uniana. The temple here contains a superb Har-Gouri statue. The trek further takes one to Ransi, which has a very old temple, low and built of stones entirely. Gaundar at the confluence of Madmaheshwar Ganga & Markanda Ganga is the Madmaheshwar temple and its associated dharamshala.   It is an interesting trek to the Temple of Lord Shiva which is situated at a great height.  The temple similar but smaller than Sri Kedarnath temple is located in beautiful surroundings. It is not known as who built it but it certainly is an example of great devotion the royalties had in Uttarakhand shrines. The trek starts from Guptakashi and passes through the famous Sidha Pith of Kalimath.  It is a pathway of unparalleled scenic beauty with the magnificent snow capped, peaks of Chaukhamba, Kedarnath and Nilkanth soaring up to the Heavens.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/37.jpg","max_altitude":"10002","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Ransi","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"200","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Madmaheswer","temp_range":"Min:5 Max 30","time_duration":"5 Days 4 Nights","trek_id":"35"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/madmaheshwar-trek","slug":"madmaheshwar-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
