It spills the chance to ascend the top of two very high passes, Gandala La (4800 m) & Kongmaru La (5150 m) and lets you feast your eyes on stunning sights from the summit. You also come across the charming Markha Village that is a trove in this cold semi-arid terrain of Ladakh. Other delights include witnessing the way of life of the region, crossing several streams and rivers and enjoying a trail through remote gorges and unbridled grazing grounds.   Cross over Ganda La (4800 m) and arrive at the winsome Markha Village that is laced with green fields and willow trees and has barren mountains in the backdrop. Other thrills include camping beside a gurgling stream, getting the stunning view of Kangyatze Peak and more. Till the final day, there is something to revel in every step of the way.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/141.jpg","max_altitude":"17060","near_airport":"Leh","nearest_motorable_location":"Leh","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"439","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Kongmaru La","temp_range":"Min: -5 Max: 30","time_duration":"9 Days 8 Nights","trek_id":"141"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/markha-valley","slug":"markha-valley"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
