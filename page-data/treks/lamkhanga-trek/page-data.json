The trek can be done from either side. The beautiful route takes you through some of the most remote areas of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, like the Jalandhari valley that is covered with flowers post monsoon. The snow in the early season could impede your progress. Harsil is famous for Wilson's Cottage built in 1864. Gangotri is a short drive from Harsil, while Chitkul is the last village in the Baspa valley.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/131.jpg","max_altitude":"17336","near_airport":"Shimla","nearest_motorable_location":"Chitkul","nearest_railway":"Shimla","railway_code":"SML","railway_distance":"250","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Lamkhanga Pass","temp_range":"Min: -5 Max: 15","time_duration":"14 Days 13 Nights","trek_id":"131"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/lamkhanga-trek","slug":"lamkhanga-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
