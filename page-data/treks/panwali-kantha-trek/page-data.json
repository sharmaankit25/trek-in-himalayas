The moderate altitude and easy access make it a fantastic winter trek.  There are several routes that you can choose to go on this trek. You can start at Sonprayag and end at Ghuttu, or you can start at Ghuttu and end the trek at Trijuginarayan temple. In winter, however, it often becomes a tad tricky to cross Panwali Kantha and go to Triyugi Narayan because of excessive snowfall.  A short trek to Panwali Kantha has just the right amount of snow and can be safely completed without intense preparations. Contingency planning is necessary though, because if there?s heavy snowfall, the routes might be blocked.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/36.jpg","max_altitude":"11500","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Ghuttu","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"184","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Panwali Kantha","temp_range":"Min: 2 Max:15","time_duration":"6 Days 5 Nights","trek_id":"34"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/panwali-kantha-trek","slug":"panwali-kantha-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
