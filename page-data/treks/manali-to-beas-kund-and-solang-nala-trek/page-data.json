The trek takes you away from the hustle and bustle of Manali. Following the banks of Beas River expect great views of Pir Pinjal ranges. The meadows of Dhundi & Bakarthach are spectacular in its beauty. As you climb higher you reach the origin of River Beas. A small glacial lake is feeded by the melting snow of the higher peaks of the region. This trek is suitable for all age groups and no trekking expeirence is required to do it.  Some people prefer mountains and some ocean. And then there are some who have a soft spot in their heart for rivers, meadows, flora or fauna, and would travel endless hours just to witness such isolated miracles of nature rarely witnessed in the proximity of any human settlements. Similarly, I have always had a fascination with high altitude alpine lakes. The contrasting sight of a peaceful water body nestled between jagged mountain peaks has always managed to get my pulses racing.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/81.jpg","max_altitude":"12100","near_airport":"Bhuntar (Kullu)","nearest_motorable_location":"Solang Valley","nearest_railway":"Jogindernagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"157","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Beas Kund","temp_range":"Min: -5 Max: 13","time_duration":"2 Days 1 Nights","trek_id":"81"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/manali-to-beas-kund-and-solang-nala-trek","slug":"manali-to-beas-kund-and-solang-nala-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
