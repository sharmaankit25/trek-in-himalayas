During this trip we are about to meet with locals and monks and visit monasteries and villages.  Through a pleasant 65km-drive intervening valleys and mountain ranges, as well as the Indus River, we arrive at Saspotse village, just behind Likir. Then, a 4-hour trek later, we reach the Lago La Base camp, after going through Shepherds Place. We will be trekking along SaspolTokpo, exploring TsoSermo before we start our 9-hour trekking for RakurukDoksa. On our way, we will pass Lago La, the TsoChingGongma River, the Zanskar Range and the Saltoro Range.  After arriving at RakurukDoksa we will take the Rakuruk-Skuru trek route and indulge ourselves at the gurgling waters or the streams, basins and rivers we pass by until we reach Khardong La. Finally, we will visit quaint villages of Diskit, Sumur and Hunder on the Nubra Valley.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/149.jpg","max_altitude":"17717","near_airport":"Leh","nearest_motorable_location":"Leh","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"439","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Lago La pass","temp_range":"Min: -15 Max: 10","time_duration":"6 Days 5 Nights","trek_id":"149"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/saspotse-to-skuru-trek","slug":"saspotse-to-skuru-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
