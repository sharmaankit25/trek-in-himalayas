Forming a bridge between the north-west ridge of Gangotri-III and Jogin-I, the altitude attained is 5,390 meters. The trek to Auden's Col is one of the toughest treks in the region of Garhwal Himalayas and that is why it is least explored by normal trekkers, a dream for all the ardent trekkers. This trek passes through the thick meadows dotted with varied species of flowers, alpine forests, gushing streams and en route many villages. Even being a strenuous trail, the journey is treated with the majestic views of the beautiful high peaks like the Bhagirathi, Rudragaira, Jogin and Kedar Dome.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/15.jpg","max_altitude":"18012","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Gangotri","nearest_railway":"Dehradun","railway_code":"DDN","railway_distance":"242","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Auden s Col","temp_range":"Min: -8 Max: 15","time_duration":"16 Days 15 Nights","trek_id":"15"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/auden-col-trek","slug":"auden-col-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
