The trek begins at Kafnoo in Kinnaur.? The trail ascends along the left bank of the wanger river after crossing a footbridge.? The path climbs through single crop fields of Mustrang village and passes through a mixed forest of conifers and temperate broad-leafed species.? The trail climbs through little clearings of potato and buckwheat till it reaches the meadows of Muling (3350 meters/11,000 feet), fringed by birch and wild cherry.? From here the trail continues to Pistrang, a sheltered glade with a spring at one end and over a steep ascent to the pass.?? The descent is more gradual to the Pin Valley, over boulder-strewn glaciers, making it a sharp contrast to lush green Kinnaur.? This trek is combined with a drive through Spitti and its many important monasteries and quaint villages to make it a unique experience only the valleys of Kinnaur and Spitti can provide.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/117.jpg","max_altitude":"15912","near_airport":"Shimla","nearest_motorable_location":"Kafnu","nearest_railway":"Shimla","railway_code":"SML","railway_distance":"201","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Bhaba Pass","temp_range":"Min: -2 Max: 20","time_duration":"8 Days 7 Nights","trek_id":"117"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/kinnaur-spiti-bhabha-pass-trek","slug":"kinnaur-spiti-bhabha-pass-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
