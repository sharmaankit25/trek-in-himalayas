Legend holds that Bhrigh Rishi meditated here, and that many local gods of the Kullu Valley visit to take a dip in its sacred water.  Nestled in the lap of nature, the state of Himachal Pradesh is nothing less than a heaven for nature lovers. Bhrigu Lake is close to habitation, yet in a secluded lush green gorge. The Bhrigu Lake is at an altitude of 4235 metres lying east of the Rohtang Pass and is 6 km from Gulaba.  Steep ups and downs can make you a bit tired but they are equally rewarding because of its tremendous views.
