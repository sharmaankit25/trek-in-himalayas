This encompasses a plethora of jaw-dropping sights alongside the gorgeous ravines and canyons of Ladakh that serves as the only means of communication between the hamlets of Zanskar Valley and Chilling.Trekking in Chadar is laden with a bunch of unique experiences that include walking on the Zanskar frozen River which is literally a sheet of ice with glacial waters running underneath and camping out in inhospitable conditions inside caves. The journey of Zanskar Chadar trek takes one through beautiful sightings of hanging icicles, breathtaking iced-peaks set against turquoise skies and charming Tibetan prayer flags. In some areas, the ?Chadar? or ice sheet forms only on the corners of the Zanskar River that become narrow ledges through which trekkers cross by crawling under dangerous overhang rocks. At times, the Chadar even breaks right under one?s feet and floats away like a raft. The Chadar frozen river trek is open only during winter when the ice sheet is most stable.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/144.jpg","max_altitude":"12303","near_airport":"Leh","nearest_motorable_location":"Leh","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"439","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Chadar Frozen River","temp_range":"Min: -25 Max: 0","time_duration":"5 Days 4 Nights","trek_id":"144"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/chader-frozen-river-trek","slug":"chader-frozen-river-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
