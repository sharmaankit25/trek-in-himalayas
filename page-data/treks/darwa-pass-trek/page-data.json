The place changes every moment, every second, so much so that the same place looks entirely different and hence adds a new dimension to the beauty it already possesses. Almost everyone who is a mountain lover or trekker is familiar with the Dodital and Darwa top trek. Dodital lies in the Garhwal Himalayas bordered by the Bandarpoonch and Swargarohini ranges on one side. It opens up through the Darwa Pass towards Yamunotri on the other.It is considered the birthplace of Lord Ganesha and home to the fresh water Himalayan Trout, the beauty of this lake matched by few others. While most people attempt this trek in April-June or September-November, like I did way back in 1999; winter adds a magical feather to this trek?s already beautiful cap. So we (four of my friends and I) decided to attempt this trek in December, precisely December 17th to 25th, 2009.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/20.jpg","max_altitude":"13615","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Sangamchatti","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"181","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Darwa","temp_range":"Min: 0 Max: 15","time_duration":"6 Days 5 Nights","trek_id":"20"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/darwa-pass-trek","slug":"darwa-pass-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
