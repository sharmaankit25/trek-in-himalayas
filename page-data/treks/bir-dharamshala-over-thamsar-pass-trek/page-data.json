The Thamsar of my dreams. The Thamsar that leads to Bada Bhangal. Never judge Thamsar by what I have to say. I dreamt of going to this pass since I was 3 and it took me 25 years before it became a reality. Named probably after one of the lakes on either side of the pass, Thamsar has a romantic appeal paralleled by none. Leading to a village of 400 people, over a centuries old mule trail, its your pass to bliss, a pass to another land, a land untouched by road. There are some makeshift shops on the way, 2 beautiful lakes on either side of the pass, Pir Panjals, 3 sister peaks above Panhartoo, lush green meadows with fabulous yellow flowers and a few waterfalls.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/76.jpg","max_altitude":"15502","near_airport":"Gaggal","nearest_motorable_location":"Bir","nearest_railway":"Kangra","railway_code":"KGRA","railway_distance":"66","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Thamsar Pass","temp_range":"Min: -1 Max: 25","time_duration":"12 Days 11 Nights","trek_id":"76"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/bir-dharamshala-over-thamsar-pass-trek","slug":"bir-dharamshala-over-thamsar-pass-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
