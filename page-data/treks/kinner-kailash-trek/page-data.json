A natural pond/Kund near Kinnar Kailash peak, known as Parvati Kund, is considered to be a creation of Goddess Parvati. She worshipped here for a long time. It is also the meeting place for Lord Shiva and Mata Parvati . For this reason Ganesh Park or Kailash Darshan Park was earlier called Ashiqui Park.  Mythology states that Lord Shiva conducted a meeting of Goddesses and Gods at Kinner Kailash peak every winter. This accounts for the Yatra that takes place every year during this time by devotees of Lord Shiva and local deities.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/44.jpg","max_altitude":"15004","near_airport":"Shimla","nearest_motorable_location":"Tangling","nearest_railway":"Shimla","railway_code":"SML","railway_distance":"212","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Kinner Kailash","temp_range":"Min: 0 Max: 20","time_duration":"4 Days 3 Nights","trek_id":"44"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/kinner-kailash-trek","slug":"kinner-kailash-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
