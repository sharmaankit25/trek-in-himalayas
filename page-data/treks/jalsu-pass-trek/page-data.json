Gaddies of Bharmour especially the resident of Holi valley used this trek whenever they have to go Kangra District instead of long bus route. Even local peoples run this trek in a day from Nayagram to Baijnath. This route is not as popular with tourists as some other Dhauladhar passes; Jalsu is an experience in itself.
