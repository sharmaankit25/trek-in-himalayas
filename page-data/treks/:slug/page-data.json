She had everything she needed, but she was missing a mirror. She asked Lord Shiva for a mirror. Lord Shiva dug the earth with his Trishool and formed a pond. The pond (kund) had such clear water that it reflected just like a mirror. Devi Parvathi could see her beauty (roop) in that pond (kund). Hence, the name Roopkund. Roopkund is a small lake above the snowline of the Greater Himalayas. It is a very small swallow lake, maximum 2 meters in depth and generally remain under the snow for 8 months in a year. At the first glance, nothing special is here. I mean, a 2 meter deep lake, that too without water, is not worth visiting after 24 hours of road journey from Delhi and then a 3-days trek in the middle of a dense forest of Burans, a widespread meadow, some steep climbs on the hills, where you spend your night in a small tent. The nights are freezing cold, body easily become tired due to the thinner air and a single mistake can be fatal at this height. and we do all this for a 2 meters deep hole, that doesn?t even look like a lake.","header_img_url":"https://www.wildadda.com/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/1.jpg","max_altitude":"16000","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Lohajung","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"260","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Roopkund","temp_range":"Min: -30 Max: 10","time_duration":"7 Days 6 Nights","trek_id":"1"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/:slug"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
