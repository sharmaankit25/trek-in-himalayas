Leh with an area of 45110 Sq Km makes it largest district in the country in terms of area.  Leh India is one of the favorite tourist destinations located in the northernmost parts of the country. Lapped in the snow-covered fringes of the Himalayas, Leh India has been the center of Tibeto-Buddhist culture since ages. Its colorful gompas have attracted the devout Buddhists from all over the globe. Besides, it is also a favorite hiking locale and is known for some of the best hikes in India.  In geological terms, this is a young land, formed only a few million years ago by the buckling and folding of the earth's crust as the Indian sub-continent pushed with irresistible force against the immovable mass of Asia. Its basic contours, uplifted by these unimaginable tectonic movements, have been modified over the millennia by the opposite process of erosion, sculpted into the form we see today by wind and water.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/159.jpg","max_altitude":"18380","near_airport":"Leh","nearest_motorable_location":"Leh","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"439","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Pangong lake","temp_range":"Min: -8 Max: 10","time_duration":"6 Days 5 Nights","trek_id":"159"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/the-land-of-lamas-with-pangong-la","slug":"the-land-of-lamas-with-pangong-la"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
