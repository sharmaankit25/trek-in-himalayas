We were wrong. It is the Tarsar Marsar. It has terrific similarity with the Kashmir Great Lakes trek: superb meadows, wide open plains, impressive lakes, grand mountain views, but with one very big difference. The Tarsar Marsar trek has lot more variety. There are valleys that are flower-decked with such density that it takes careful stepping not to trample on flowers. There are streams that fall on ledges, creating shallow swimming pools that are surrounded by grassy knolls. The camp sites are in terrific settings. The Tarsar Marsar trek is a new experience of what beauty on a trek can be.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/157.jpg","max_altitude":"13500","near_airport":"Sri Nagar","nearest_motorable_location":"Aru","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"96","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Tarsar","temp_range":"Min: -4 Max: 10","time_duration":"7 Days 6 Nights","trek_id":"157"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/tarsar-marsar-trek","slug":"tarsar-marsar-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
