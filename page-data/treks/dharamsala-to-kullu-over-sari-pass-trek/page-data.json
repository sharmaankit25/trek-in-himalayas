The trek to the Sari Pass at an altitude of 3760 m gives the traveler the intoxicating thrill of a Himalayan trek. The trek begins at Bir in the Kangra district and is about 50 km from Dharamshala. The trail moves to Billing, a barren ridge known for the adventure sport activities. The climb is a gentle rambling through the rhododendron vegetation and spectacular views of the valley on either side of the Ruling River. The trail then descends and again climbs up to the lovely village of Lohardi. For people who lack time or strength for a Himalayan trek the trek can start at Lohardi as buses ply till here. The path from here is well defined with a moderate ascent to Lahesh Caves.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/114.jpg","max_altitude":"12336","near_airport":"Gaggal","nearest_motorable_location":"McLeod Ganj","nearest_railway":"Kangra","railway_code":"KGRA","railway_distance":"27","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Sari Pass","temp_range":"Min: -2 Max: 20","time_duration":"8 Days 7 Nights","trek_id":"114"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/dharamsala-to-kullu-over-sari-pass-trek","slug":"dharamsala-to-kullu-over-sari-pass-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
