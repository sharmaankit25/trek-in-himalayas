Following this is a trek to Pangarchula peak which is challenging to state the least navigating through deep snowy terrains, bouldering rocks and steep slopes.  Upon reaching the peak of Kuari, marvel at the awe-striking peaks and passes along with the confluence of several rivers, gorgeous forests and sprawling meadows, also known as ?Bugyals?. If lucky, one also gets to spot footprints of either the Himalayan Bear or Leopard.  Apart from the Kuari Pass trekking, the exciting climb up to the summit of Pangarchula Peak at 4700 m is quite a moderate trek. For those unwilling to participate in this trek, there is the Mini Pangarchula Peak trek at 4200 m or one can even relax at the base camp. At the peak of Pangarchula, enjoy the pleasurable sights of scintillating peaks and its environs. In addition to that, one also gets to stay in the cosy Eco Lodge in Auli.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/uttarakhand/12.jpg","max_altitude":"15419","near_airport":"Jolly Grant Airport","nearest_motorable_location":"Auli","nearest_railway":"Rishikesh","railway_code":"RKSH","railway_distance":"265","state_id":"1","state_name":"Uttarakhand","summit_point":"Pangarchulla Peak","temp_range":"Min: -2 Max: 20","time_duration":"6 Days 5 Nights","trek_id":"12"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/pangarchulla-trek","slug":"pangarchulla-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
