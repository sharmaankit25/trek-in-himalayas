Sandwiched between the Indus Valley and the main crest of the Indian Himalaya, this remote and inaccessible setting well guarded by snowy mountain passes, has kept alive an archaic form of Tibetan Buddhism which flourishes in chain of far-flung monasteries, most of which occupy spectacular fortified locations, high on rocky ridges in isolated valleys.On the way you get to visit some ancient monasteries dramatically built on jagged hillsides and also stop and meet the Friendly Zanskari inhabitants. Quaint villages, high grassy meadows, a few crystal clear springs, shimmering snow clad mountains and the beauty of the desolate landscape makes this a fascinating trek.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/himachal/103.jpg","max_altitude":"16732","near_airport":"Bhuntar (Kullu)","nearest_motorable_location":"Darcha","nearest_railway":"Jogindernagar","railway_code":"JDNX","railway_distance":"288","state_id":"2","state_name":"Himachal Pradesh","summit_point":"Shingola pass","temp_range":"Min: -7 Max: 20","time_duration":"21 Days 20 Nights","trek_id":"103"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/manali-darcha-lamayuru-leh-trek","slug":"manali-darcha-lamayuru-leh-trek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
