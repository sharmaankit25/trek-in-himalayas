The trek passes through lush greenery and a frozen lake. From the glaciers, a path leads up the Shakhdar Hill. Tourists can enjoy delightful views of the glacier and its surroundings from the hill. Tourists travelling to Thajiwas Glacier during early summer can meet people from the Gujar tribe going towards the alpine meadows. They visit Sonmarg during the summer months to earn money and return to Jammu when the winters start setting-in.  The ascent up the Sindh River makes Thajiwas Glacier even more amazing and exciting. About 5Km from the glacier is a beautiful place where tourists can see nature at its best. The meadow is covered with fir and pine trees and the area has a number of waterfalls making it look like paradise. With the Himalayas surrounding the area, Thajiwas Glacier is an excellent destination to enjoy some fun time in natural settings.","header_img_url":"/images/trek-header/jandk/156.jpg","max_altitude":"9843","near_airport":"Sri Nagar","nearest_motorable_location":"Sonamarg","nearest_railway":"Sri Nagar","railway_code":"SINA","railway_distance":"103","state_id":"4","state_name":"Jammu and Kashmir","summit_point":"Thajiwas Glacier","temp_range":"Min: 0 Max: 20","time_duration":"1 Days 0 Nights","trek_id":"156"}},"pageContext":{"matchPath":"/treks/thajiwas-glacier","slug":"thajiwas-glacier"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
